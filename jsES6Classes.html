            // 1. You use a FUNCTION as a CONSTRUCTOR, and;
            // 2. You use a PROTOTYPE for DEFINING INSTANCE METHODS, and;

            // A class is an entity responsible for creating objects and defining the behaviour of objects.
            // Classes may be objects in their own right, but if they are, they’re different from other types of objects.
            // All objects in a “classical” system have a class, and their class is a “class.”

            // JavaScript objects don’t have a formal class, and thus there’s no special syntax for defining how to create an instance or define its behaviour.

            // JavaScript instances are created with a constructor. The constructor of an instance is a function that was invoked with the new operator.

            // In JavaScript, any function can be a constructor, even if it doesn’t look like one:

            // EXAMPLE OF JS FUNCTION SHORTHAND


            // Arrow functions do not have their own arguments object. Thus, in this example, arguments is simply a reference to the arguments of the enclosing scope:
            // ===================JS Arrow functions============================
            var arguments = [1, 2, 3];
            var arr = () => arguments[0];

            console.log("arr: " + arr()); // 1


            const wrap = (something) => {
              const wrapped = [something];

              return wrapped;
            }
            //=================== End JS arrow functions========================
            wrap("package")
              //=> ["package"]
            console.log(wrap("package"))

            function square (n) { return n * n; }
              //=> undefined
            console.log(square(2));
              //=> 4
            console.log("\n");
            console.log(square(2).constructor);
              //=> [Function: Number]
            console.log("\n");
            console.log(new square(2));
              //=> {}
            console.log("\n");
            console.log(new square(2).constructor);
            console.log("\n");
              //=> [Function: square]
            // As you can see, the square function will act as a constructor if you call it with new. There is no special kind of thing that constructs new objects, every function is (potentially) a constructor.


            // How does JavaScript define the behaviour of instances? JavaScript doesn’t have a special syntax or special kind of object for that, it has “prototypes.” Prototypes are objects, but unlike a classical system, there are no special methods or properties associated with a prototype. Any object can be a prototype, even an empty object. In fact, that’s exactly what is associated with a constructor by default:

            function Nullo () {};
            Nullo.prototype
              //=> {}

            // There’s absolutely nothing special about a prototype object. No special class methods, no special constructor of its own, nothing. Let’s look at a simple Queue in JavaScript:

            var Queue = function () {
              this.array = [];
              this.head = 0;
              this.tail = -1;
            };
            Queue.prototype.pushTail = function (value) {
              return this.array[this.tail += 1] = value;
            };
            Queue.prototype.pullHead = function () {
              var value;

              if (!this.isEmpty()) {
                  // isEmpty() : boolean
                  // boolean	True if the string is empty; otherwise false.
                value = this.array[this.head];
                this.array[this.head] = void 0;
                // This operator allows evaluating expressions that produce a value into places where an expression that evaluates to undefined is desired.
                //
                // The void operator is often used merely to obtain the undefined primitive value, usually using "void(0)" (which is equivalent to "void 0").
                this.head += 1;
                return value;
              }
            };
            Queue.prototype.isEmpty = function () {
              return this.tail < this.head;
            };
            console.log("\n");
            console.log(Queue.prototype);
              //=>  { pushTail: [Function],
                      // pullHead: [Function],
                      // isEmpty: [Function] }



            // The first way a prototype in JavaScript is different from a class in Ruby is that the prototype is an ordinary object with exactly the same properties that we expect to find in an instance: Methods pushTail, pullHead, and isEmpty.

            // The second way is that any object can be a prototype. It can have functions (which act like methods), it can have other values (like numbers, booleans, objects, or strings). It can be an object you’re using for something else: An account, a view, a DOM object if you’re in the browser, anything.

            // “Classes” are objects in most “classical” languages, but they are a special kind of object. In JavaScript, prototypes are not a special kind of object, they’re just objects.

            // JavaScript splits the responsibility for instances into a constructor and a prototype. A constructor in JavaScript can be any function. Constructors are responsible for creating new instances.

            // A prototype in JavaScript can be any object. Prototypes are responsible for defining the behaviour of instances. prototypes don’t have special methods or properties.


            // Instance behaviour in JavaScript is defined by modifying the prototype directly, e.g. by adding functions to it as properties. There is no special syntax for defining a class or modifying a class.

            // Because, if:

            // 1. You use a function as a constructor, and;
            // 2. You use a prototype for defining instance methods, and;
            // 3. The prototype is used strictly for defining the instance methods and nothing else;

            // Then:
            //
            // \/\/\/ You will have something that works just like a simple class-based system, with the constructor function and its prototype acting as the “class.” \/\/\/

            console.log("\n");

            // With the introduction of ES6, JavaScript developers now have access to the Class keyword. However, don't be fooled: ES6's Classes are just syntactic wrappers around the Object Constructors we've already learned.
            // Under the hood, Classes and Object Constructors largely behave the same way. The benefit we get is easier syntax to read and write.
            // Class and constructor
            // Let's define a simple class: Dot. Dots have an x value and a y value. Consider the below definition:

            // class Dot {
            //     constructor(x, y){
            //         this.x = x;
            //         this.y = y;
            //     }
            // }
            // We're defining our class using the class keyword. In addition, we're defining a method called constructor. All ES6 classes have a constructor, and the constructor always runs whenever we create a new instance. Try running this next example:
            class Dot {
                constructor(x,y){
                    this.x = x;
                    this.y = y;
                    console.log("You created a Dot");
                }
            }
            let dot1 = new Dot(10,10);

            // That console log fired when we invoked the new keyword. Also take note: Classes are NOT hoisted. No matter what, the class keyword will stay where it was written and not move during interpretation.

            // Old ES5 way
            function Dot2(x, y) {
                this.x = x;
                this.y = y;
            }
            Dot2.prototype.showLocation = function() {
                console.log("This Dot is at x " + this.x + " and y " + this.y);
            }
            const dot2 = new Dot2(55, 20);
            dot2.showLocation();

            // THE NEW ES6 way
            class Dot3 {
                constructor(x, y){
                    this.x = x;
                    this.y = y;
                }
                showLocation(){
                    //ES6 String Interpolation!
                    console.log(`This Dot is at x ${this.x} and y ${this.y}`);
                }
            }
            const dot3 = new Dot3(5,13);
            dot3.showLocation();

            //  The two above examples are doing the exact same thing. The key difference is syntax.
            // Also take note, adding methods to ES6 classes is the same as adding prototype methods to object constructors.
            // These get added to the prototype chain in the same way.



            //=============CLASS METHODS VS INSTANCE METHODS==================


            // In ES6, Class methods are called 'static methods`,

             // while Instance methods are called 'prototype methods'.

             // We've already seen prototype methods, now let's look at a static method. Let's say we want to add a new function to the class Dot, not an instance of a Dot:

             class Dot4 {
                 constructor(x,y){
                     this.x = x;
                     this.y = y;
                 }
                // prototype method
                showLocation(){
                    console.log(`This Dot is at x ${this.x} and y ${this.y}`);
                }
                // Static method
                static getHelp(){
                    console.log("This is a Dot class, for created Dots! A Dot takes x and y coordinates, type 'new Dot' to create one");
                }
             }

             const dot4 = new Dot4(4,2);
             // we can see showLocation from our instance...
             console.log(dot4.showLocation);
             // but we can't see getHelp
             console.log(dot4.getHelp);
             // however we can call getHelp this way:
             Dot4.getHelp();
             // Here we added a static method called getHelp(). This means that getHelp() is accessible from the Class, not the instance.
